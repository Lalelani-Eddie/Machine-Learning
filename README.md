Color quantization is a process in image processing and computer vision that involves reducing the number of distinct colors present in an image while preserving its visual quality. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques such as clustering, specifically K-means clustering, color quantization identifies representative colors from the image dataset. It treats each pixel's color values as data points in a high-dimensional space and groups them into clusters based on their similarity. The centroids of these clusters represent the dominant colors in the image. By quantizing the colors, the image can be displayed or stored more efficiently with a reduced color palette, which can improve compression efficiency, reduce file size, and facilitate faster processing in applications like image compression, digital printing, and web graphics optimization.

This repository focuses on implementing and exploring various algorithms for color quantization, leveraging unsupervised learning methods to achieve efficient reduction of color complexity in images while maintaining their visual fidelity. The project aims to provide tools and insights into how different clustering approaches, including K-means and potentially other algorithms like Gaussian mixture models or hierarchical clustering, can be applied to achieve optimal color reduction results in practical applications such as image compression, printing technologies, and web graphics optimization.
